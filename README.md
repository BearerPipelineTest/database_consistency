# DatabaseConsistency

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/djezzzl/database_consistency.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/djezzzl/database_consistency)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/database_consistency.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/database_consistency)

The main goal of the project is to provide an easy way to check the consistency of the 
database constraints with the application validations.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'database_consistency', group: :development, require: false
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install database_consistency
```

## Usage

In the root directory of your Rails project run `bundle exec database_consistency`. 
To get a full output run `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG bundle exec database_consistency`.

You can also configure the gem to skip some of its checks using [.database_consistency.yml](example/.database_consistency.yml) file. 

## How it works?

- As first step, we iterate over all validators and check their consistency with the database constraints. 
Right now, we only check consistency for presence validator. 
- As second step, we iterate over all column in the database and check if they have proper validations. 
Right now, we only check if field should have presence validator.  

### PresenceComparator

This comparator is used for *PresenceValidator*.

| allow_nil/allow_blank/if/unless | database | status |
| :-----------------------------: | :------: | :----: |
| at least one provided           | required | fail   |
| at least one provided           | optional | ok     |
| all missed                      | required | ok     |
| all missed                      | optional | fail   |  

### PresenceMissingVerifier

We fail if the column satisfy conditions:
- column is required in the database
- column is not a primary key (we don't need need presence validators for primary keys)
- model records timestamps and column's name is not `created_at` or `updated_at`
- column is not used for any Presence or Inclusion validators, or BelongsTo reflection
- column has not a default value

## Example

```
$ bundle exec database_consistency
fail column phone of table users of model User should be required in the database
fail column name of table users of model User is required but possible null value insert
fail column code of table users of model User is required but do not have presence validator
```

See [example](example) project for more details.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, 
update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git 
tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
